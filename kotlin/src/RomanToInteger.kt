 *
 * Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.
 *
 * Symbol       Value
 * I            1
 * V            5
 * X            10
 * L            50
 * C            100
 * D            500
 * M            1000
 *
 * For example, two is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together.
 * Twelve is written as, XII, which is simply X + II.
 * The number twenty seven is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.
 *
 * Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right.
 * However, the numeral for four is not IIII.
 * Instead, the number four is written as IV.
 * Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four.
 * The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX.
 *
 * There are six instances where subtraction is used:
 * 1. I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.
 * 2. X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.
 * 3. C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
 *
 * Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.
 * Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: "III"
 * Output: 3
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: "IV"
 * Output: 4
 *
 * Example 3:
 * Input: "IX"
 * Output: 9
 *
 * Example 4:
 * Input: "LVIII"
 * Output: 58
 * Explanation: L = 50, V = 5, III = 3.
 *
 * Example 5:
 * Input: "MCMXCIV"
 * Output: 1994
 * Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.

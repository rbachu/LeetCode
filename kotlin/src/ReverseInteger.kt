 *
 * Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: 123
 * Output: 321
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: -123
 * Output: -321
 *
 * Example 3:
 * Input: 120
 * Output: 21
 *
 * Note:
 * Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−2^31,  2^31 − 1].
 * For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.

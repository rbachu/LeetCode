 *
 * Determine whether an integer is a palindrome.
 * An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: 121
 * Output: true
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: -121
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
 *
 * Example 3:
 * Input: 10
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
